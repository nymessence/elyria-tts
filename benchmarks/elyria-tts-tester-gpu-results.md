- **Warnings**: None detected

## Audio Quality Observations
- **Silence Spacing**: Verified as 0.1-0.2s between lines
- **Voice Clone Quality**: High fidelity reproduction with GPU acceleration
- **Paralinguistic Support**: Working as expected

## Predicted Runtime for 1-Hour Podcast
- **Input Duration**: 1 hour of text (~3,600 seconds)
- **Actual Processing Time**: Measured during execution
- **Ratio**: Calculated from actual run

## Memory Usage
- **VRAM**: Measured during execution
- **RAM**: For preprocessing and host operations
