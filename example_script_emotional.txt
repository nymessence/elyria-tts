Hello. I am Nya Elyria. [chuckle]
I'm feeling quite cheerful today! [laugh]
But sometimes I can feel a bit sad. [sigh]
When I'm excited, I get really energetic! [breath]
And if something surprises me, I might gasp. [gasp]
Sometimes I whisper softly like this. [whisper] This is a whispered sentence.
Other times I might speak with more intensity! [emphasis]
I can also sound tired when I'm sleepy. [yawn]
Or sound happy and bubbly! [giggle]
And when I'm thinking, I might pause like this... [pause]
Overall, I try to express different emotions through my voice. [cough] Like that.
